## [Iris](https://github.com/vorpalhex/iris)
Iris is my main ~~time waster~~ side project. She's a bot that exists across multiple services, keeps track of people, and generally tries to be useful. She also has some really neat design patterns including using [Loki](http://lokijs.org/) as her durable store and the ability to update herself via githook.
