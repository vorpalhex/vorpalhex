Hi there,

I'm VorpalHex. You likely know me from the internet, including Github, HN, Freenode or many other such places. I write a lot of random code, argue about philosophy, and make delicious :cocktail: from time to time.

This is pretty much my mental dumping ground for poorly thought out or otherwise incomplete ideas. I'm sorry you came here and are reading this.
