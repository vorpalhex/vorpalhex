Spent the weekend at Pax which was amazing but came back to some disappointing news.

## Pax South

Pax South was amazing. It always strikes me how friendly Pax is, despite being a massive event. The crowd is really kind and it's an awesome experience. Lots of great games (especially Indie) games coming up. Looking forward to Dreadnought especially. Lots of great merch as always, including Musterbrand and Sanshee.
