This blog isn't all that interesting tech wise, but I wanted to take a moment to cover it for those with a passing interest. It's a [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) core with a very hacked on [midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight) theme, currently using [jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) for the :heart:s, :poop: and :laughing:. 

Code is styled with the very fancy and very awesome [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font so that things like this are a thing:

```javascript
'use strict';
const myFunc = (...args) => {
  if(args.length >= 1 && args[0] === true) {
    ...
  }
}
```

(Those weird compound symbols are called ['ligatures'](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant-ligatures) and they're a neat new-ish html5/css3 feature.

Next up is to get blog links unfurling in slack correctly (that's the little embedded view of a page when you post a link) by adding in SEO tags, and then to also look into fixing the RSS feed.
